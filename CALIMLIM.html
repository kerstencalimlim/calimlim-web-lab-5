    <h1>All about HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>HTML is stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext is simply a piece of text that works as a link. Markup Language is a way of writing layout information within documents. Basically an HTML document is a plain text file that contains text and nothing else.Every HTML document needs a title. Here is what you need to type: Change the text from "My first HTML document" to suit your own needs. Thetitle text is preceded by the start tag <title> and ends with thematching end tag </title>. The title should be placed at the beginningof your document. To try this out, type the above into a text editor and save the file as"test.html", then view the file in a web browser. </p>
        
        <p>While CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.</p>
